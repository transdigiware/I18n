# I18n
## Internationalization
Internationalization is often abbreviated as i18n (because there are 18 letters between the i and the n) and localization is abbreviated as l10n (because there are 10 letters between the l and the n.)
Because our Repositories Project is used all over the world mean global, it is a good idea to prepare this page as a development center that will one day be created a plugin so that it can be easily translated into whatever language is needed. As a developer, you may not have an easy time providing localizations for all your users; you may not speak their language after all. However, any developer can successfully internationalize a theme to allow others to create a localization without the need to modify the source code itself.
